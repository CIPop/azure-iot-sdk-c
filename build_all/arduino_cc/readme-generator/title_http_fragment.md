# AzureIoTProtocol_HTTP - Azure IoT HTTP protocol library for Arduino

This library is a port of the compact implementation of the HTTP protocol from [Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/c/readme.md) to Arduino. Together with the AzureIoTHub, it allows you to use several Arduino compatible boards with Azure IoT Hub.
